				<span class="posterpicshover"><i>Issue No. 1—The Library of Babel</i></span>, asks what it would look like for a <span class="highlight">visual maker</span> to engage with a <span class="highlight">literary text.</span>s This issue considers Jorge Luis Borge’s 1941 short story, <i>The Library of Babel</i>, and explores a close reading of it through a visual lens. It features marginalia by illustrator <a href = "https://www.rightearleft.com/" target="_blank">Martin Dupuis</a>, who scribbled on Andrew Hurley’s translation of the story published by Penguin
				Books in 1999. All text excerpts and book spread scans are from a translation of
				the work by James E. Erby published by New Directions in 2007. The blocks of 40-line babble were written using <a href = "https://libraryofbabel.info/" target="_blank">Jonathan Basile’s Library of Babel</a> text generator which, if ever completed, “would contain every possible combination of 1,312,000 characters including lower case letters, spaces, commas, and periods.” Challenging the conventions of mainstream magazine publishing and expected formats in graphic design, this issue was published as a twelve-foot long poster, <span class="highlight">intended for exhibition</span> rather than <span class="highlight">mass distribution.</span>
